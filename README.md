# calculator
A basic calculator

this is how my calculator works:

1) Enter a number (12).

2) Enter an operator (+).

3) Enter a second number (7).

4) Enter a second operator (-). At this point, it should evaluate the initial pair of numbers (12 + 7), then display the result (19).

5) Enter another number (1).

6) Enter another operator or equals sign (=). At this point, it should use the previous result (19) as the first number, the operator (-), and the new number (1) to calculate the new equation 19 - 1. You should see the result (18) on the display.
